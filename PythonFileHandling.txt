File Handling:Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
#Note: Make sure the file exists, or else you will get an error.
File Handling:
read : open() with 4 modes
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

Read file :
f = open('filename','mode for reading r') by default it will read
f = open('filename') - read by default
with open('filename','r') as f:
    content = f.read()
close file
f.close()
Read Only Parts of the File:with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read(5))-5 indicate 5 char only

Read Lines:return one line by using the readline() method
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline()) #first line
  print(f.readline()) #second line
  for x in f: #line by line
      print(x)


Python File Write: write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file
"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content
with open("demofile.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("Now the file has more content!")
with open("demofile1.txt",'w') as f:
    f.write("This is second demo file")

Overwrite Existing Content use write command:
with open("demofile1.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is new demo file fo write method!")
    f.close()
 
 Create a New File : using x command
 f = open("myfile.txt", "x")
 
 Python Delete File: 
 import os
 os.remove(filename)
 
 Check if File exist:
 if os.path.exists('filename'):return True
 
 Delete Folder:os.rmdir("myfolder")
 #You can only remove empty folders.
