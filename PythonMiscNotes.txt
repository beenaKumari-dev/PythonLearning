Scope: A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.
Global Keyword : If need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword.The global keyword makes the variable global.
Nonlocal Keyword:The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions.

Python Modules:its same as python code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name) #save this as modulename.py
 
calling the module by import func
import modulename
modulename.greeting('Beena')
 When using a function from a module, use the syntax: module_name.function_name.
Variables in Module
person1 = { "name": "John","age": 36,"country": "Norway"}
print(modulename.person1[name
Re-naming a Module : using as keyword
import modulename as mn
print(m.person1[name])
Built-in Modules:The dir() function can be used on all modules, also the ones you create yourself.

Import From Module : You can choose to import only parts from a module, by using the from keyword
from modulename import person1 as p1
print(p1[name])

Python Datetime: date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.
import datetime
x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)
print(x.year)
print(x.strftime("%A"))#will give weekday full name
Creating Date Objects:To create a date, we can use the datetime() class (constructor) of the datetime module.The datetime() class requires three parameters to create a date: year, month, day.
import datetime
x = datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 17)
print(x)

The strftime() Method:The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.

Python Math:perform mathematical tasks on numbers
Built-in Math Functions: min,max,abs,sqrt,pow,ceil,floor,pi

Python JSON:SON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
import json
json.loads(): If you have a JSON string and the result will be a Python dictionary.
Convert from JSON to Python
x =  '{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'
y = json.loads(x)
print(y["age"])
Convert from Python to JSON :json.dumps()
# a Python object (dict):
x = {  "name": "John",  "age": 30,  "city": "New York"}
# convert into JSON:
y = json.dumps(x)
# the result is a JSON string:
print(y)

Format the Result:
Use the indent parameter to define the numbers of indents: 
json.dumps(x, indent=4)
y = json.dumps(x, indent=4, sort_keys=True)


Python PIP:IP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules .
pip install package_name
pip uninstall package_name
List installed packages: pip list

User Input:
name = input('Enter your name:')
print(f"Hello {name}")

Python Try Except:
The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
The except block lets you handle the error.
The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")
else:
  print('handle try')

Raise an exception:Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.
x = -1
if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")
  
Python Virtual Environment:A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.
Creating a Virtual Environment
Python has the built-in venv module for creating virtual environments.
Steps:navigate to the folder where you want to create your project, then type this command 
python -m venv myfirstproject
Activate Virtual Environment:use the virtual environment, you have to activate it with this command
>myfirstproject\Scripts\activate

Install Packages:pip install cowsay

Deactivate Virtual Environment
To deactivate the virtual environment use this command:> deactivate

Delete Virtual Environment:> rmdir /s /q myfirstproject
